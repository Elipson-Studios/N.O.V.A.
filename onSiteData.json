    "Terms": {
        "Quantum computing": "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. It has the potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers.",
        "Big data": "Big data refers to large and complex data sets that are difficult to process using traditional data processing applications. It involves the collection, storage, and analysis of massive amounts of data to extract valuable insights and information.",
        "Cloud computing": "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics, over the internet (the cloud) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.",
        "Internet of Things (IoT)": "The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet.",
        "Blockchain": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows data to be stored globally on thousands of servers while letting anyone on the network see everyone else's entries in real-time. This makes it difficult for one user to gain control of the network.",
        "Cybersecurity": "Cybersecurity involves protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, theft, and damage. It includes practices and technologies designed to safeguard information and ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
        "Virtual Reality (VR)": "Virtual Reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. It typically involves the use of VR headsets to generate realistic images, sounds, and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment.",
        "Augmented Reality (AR)": "Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience where real-world environments are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, and olfactory.",
        "5G": "5G is the fifth generation of mobile network technology, designed to deliver faster speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connections on smartphones and other devices compared to previous generations.",
        "Edge Computing": "Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth.",
